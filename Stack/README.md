#Stack Definition

Stacks as a data structure are a lot like stacks as a physical structure. Think of stacks of dishes or books. Stacks operate in a last in first out nature. Newer items are at the top of the stack and will be accessed first whereas older items are near the bottom and will be accessed last. Back buttons, undo buttons, and the function call stack are common uses of stacks. Common methods include:

Push - add an item to the top of the stack.
Pop - remove the top item from the stack.
Peek - check to see the top item of the stack.


Implement two Stacks using 1. a Linked List 2. using an Array



#Constructor (when including in a class)
The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class. A SyntaxError will be thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.

A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of the super class.
